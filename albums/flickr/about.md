# About Me on &trade;Flickr

Programmer from **Hangzhou**, one of the most beautiful cities of China and the world.

## Equipments

Take photos by old snapshot cameras (now Sigma DP2m) and Android phones (now Huawei Mate 10), instead of my lovely Nikon F4/F100/FA camera, Ai 20mm/f4, Ai 50mm/f2, Ai-s 200mm/f4 and Tokina 24-200mm lenses, in life and on trips. 

In those years I was planning on the fulfilling of my fantastic Nikon lenses collection, including Ai-s 24mm/f2, Ai 28mm/f2, Ai 35mm/f2, Ai 85mm/f2, Ai 105mm/f2, Ai-s 300mm/f4 and 70-180mm macro; and hold the dream of Olympus OM-4 Ti with its Zuiko F2 lenses series, Hasselblad 903 SWC, and Mamiya 7 series, but those above are too expensive to a young man, and soon came era of digital.

Now I'm thinking about Hasselbkad's X1D or Fujifilm's G50R but I wanna a real 16-bit DAC, and Sigma's next generation of 1:1:1 Foveon sensor. Also I would like the M-E/Monochrom from Leica. But all listed above is charming except their price... -_-

## Stuff

Favor on **_landscapes_**, especially of large scenario. So that I created the group __[**Large Scenery**](https://www.flickr.com/groups/large-scenery/)__: 

[![**Large Scenery**](https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1908/43460816250_2999fd17eb_s.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/groups/large-scenery/)

Welcome anybody to join and share great pictures in it.

Also make some _nature_, _close up_, _black/white_, _documentary_, city _architecture_ and _streat_ snapshot. 

Poorly in any kind of <del>portrait</del> photography, which causes my laughed by girlfriend/wife for years.

## Manner

My dream is __making my living by traveling and photography, and programming by interesting__...

To me, photography means _observing, feeling, describing, abstracting, summarizing and constructing_ of the **world and myself**.

## Mottoes

- _Since everywhere is elsewhere,_
  _then anywhere is nowhere._

- _First we learn to fly._
  _Then we learn to cry._
  _Later in the evening we may die._

- _That all knowledge was but remembrance,_
  _and that all novelty is but oblivion._
