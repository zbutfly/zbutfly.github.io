# Large Scenery Group on &trade;Flickr

The group is for **large scenery**, mainly **landscape** for any scenery of **large**, or **huge**, or **enormous**, or **vast**, or **majestic**, or makes awarness of **tiny** and **insignificant** from all over foreground, medium spot and background.

Something elsewhere always makes me **_trembling and melted_**. Just like _mountain_, _sky_, _cloud_, _road_, _sunshine_, _sea_, _river_, _desert_, _grassland_, _forest_, _farm_, _water fall_, and even _flower crowd_ or _city overlooking_, etc.

## Policy

I created the group for my personal favor of **large scenery**, on my finding that the subject is (unbelievable) totally absent from the whole flickr groups.

_You will find nothing but maybe you will generate something in your mind herein_. That's all I can do for myself.

I will keep on leafing over Flickr and inviting great pictures into the newborn group in my free time. Besides the photo stream I would like to excavate through outstanding stuff from personal albums of my following, members of the group and passby on browsing.

**However sharing and recommendation from all members is always expected**. My ideally amount of group photos should be __tens of times__ of members.

**Anybody** and **anything** is welcomed from **anywhere**, no matter:

- film or digital
- colorful or black-white
- light or shadow
- brightsome or darksome
- camera of professional dslr or mirror-less or range-finder or small snapshot or mobile phone
- sensor of small cmos or aps-c or full frame or medium format or large format
- lenses of expensive or cheap, changable or fixed, prime or zoom, wide-angle or telephoto

The only keyword is **large scenery**, and the only principle is to be **nice** each other.

Here fanciers can share, appreciate and communicate anything about:

- stuff from you or others
- technique and skill
- photo post-processing
- equipment
- sight spots or locations
- experience of activity and traveling

		_Those above are also beautiful, but let's talk about them elsewhere_.
- Please post photos taken by **yourself**.
	_Maybe you can recommend the group to great author matching our subject but not recommend their work to here directly_.
- Please post photos with at least basic **EXIF**, **geo (GPS)** infomation is greatly encouraged.
- Please post photos **large enough** and **fine tuned** _at its best_ to contain enough detail. Thumbnail is not recommended.
- Please **title**/**describe**/**tag** your photos as many as possible.

## Tips

Since some other groups limit how many groups a photo was in on sharing to them (we don't care about that, I just care the group itself), you can:

- Share your stuff into those groups first, and share it into us at last.
- Share your stuff on uploading to hundreds of groups.
- Remove your stuff from all existed groups and re-share it to all of groups,. Of course, take care of not offending group rules about repetition posting.

## Some Mottoes

- Since everywhere is elsewhere, then anywhere is nowhere.
- First we learn to fly. Then we learn to cry. Later in the evening we may die.
- That all knowledge was but remembrance, and that all novelty is but oblivion.
